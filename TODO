generic:
 - Better handling of running/debug state, to prevent the bus to become broken when issuing a wrong combination of commands.
 - test function that checks if bus works and requests/checks the device product ID's
 - NVRAM programming
 - write man page
 - CMake build scripts

breakpoints:
 - Detect breakpoint triggering
 - Wait for breakpoint

bus:
 - GPIO based bus master as replacement for deprecated LPT port
 - Fix LPT based bus master(c2drv) to work with modern kernel
